The optimistic locking model, also referred to as optimistic concurrency control,
is a concurrency control method used in relational databases that does not use
record locking. Optimistic locking allows multiple users to attempt to update the
same record without informing the users that others are also attempting to update
the record. The record changes are validated only when the record is committed.
If one user successfully updates the record, the other users attempting to commit
their concurrent updates are informed that a conflict exists.


The pessimistic locking model prevents simultaneous updates to records. As soon as
one user starts to update a record, a lock is placed on it. Other users who attempt
to update this record are informed that another user has an update in progress. The
 other users must wait until the first user has finished committing their changes,
 thereby releasing the record lock. Only then can another user make changes based
 on the previous user's changes.
