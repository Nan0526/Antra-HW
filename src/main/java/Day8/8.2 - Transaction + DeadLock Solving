A transaction is a very small unit of a program and it may contain several lowlevel tasks.
A transaction in a database system must maintain Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and
Durability in order to ensure accuracy, completeness, and data integrity.

-how to solve the deadlock
When a database is stuck in a deadlock, It is always better to avoid the deadlock rather
than restarting or aborting the database.
Deadlock avoidance method is suitable for smaller databases whereas the deadlock prevention
method is suitable for larger databases.
One method of avoiding deadlock is using application-consistent logic. In the above given
example, Transactions that access Students and  Grades should always access the tables in the same order.
For a large database, the deadlock prevention method is suitable. A deadlock can be prevented
 if the resources are allocated in such a way that deadlock never occurs. The DBMS analyzes
 the operations whether they can create a deadlock situation or not, If they do, that transaction
 is never allowed to be executed
