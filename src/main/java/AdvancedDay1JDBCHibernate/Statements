Once a connection is obtained we can interact with the database. The JDBC Statement, CallableStatement,
 and PreparedStatement interfaces define the methods and properties that enable you to send SQL or PL/SQL
  commands and receive data from your database.

They also define methods that help bridge data type differences between Java and SQL data types used in a database.

The following table provides a summary of each interface's purpose to decide on the interface to use:

Interfaces	        Recommended Use
Statement	        Use this for general-purpose access to your database. Useful when you are using static SQL
                    statements at runtime. The Statement interface cannot accept parameters.

PreparedStatement	Use this when you plan to use the SQL statements many times. The PreparedStatement interface
                    accepts input parameters at runtime.

CallableStatement	Use this when you want to access the database stored procedures. The CallableStatement
                    interface can also accept runtime input parameters.
