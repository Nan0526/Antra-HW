HQL & SQL:
Differences between SQL and HQL: SQL is based on a relational database model whereas HQL is a combination
 of object-oriented programming with relational database concepts. SQL manipulates data stored in tables
 and modifies its rows and columns. HQL is concerned about objects and its properties.

Criteria Query:
Hibernate provides alternate ways of manipulating objects and in turn data available in RDBMS tables.
One of the methods is Criteria API, which allows you to build up a criteria query object programmatically
 where you can apply filtration rules and logical conditions.
The Hibernate Session interface provides createCriteria() method, which can be used to create a Criteria
object that returns instances of the persistence object's class when your application executes a criteria query.
Hibernate 提供了操作对象以及 RDBMS 表中可用数据的替代方法。其中一种方法是 Criteria API，它允许您以编程方式构建条件查询对象，您可以在其中应用过滤规则和逻辑条件。
Hibernate Session 接口提供了 createCriteria() 方法，该方法可用于创建 Criteria 对象，该对象在应用程序执行条件查询时返回持久对象类的实例。
Following is the simplest example of a criteria query is one, which will simply return every object that corresponds to the Employee class.
Criteria cr = session.createCriteria(Employee.class);
List results = cr.list();

Restrictions with Criteria
You can use add() method available for Criteria object to add restriction for a criteria query.
And Other restrictions.

Native SQL:
Native SQL is the SQL that the data source uses, such as Oracle SQL. Use Native SQL to pass the SQL
statement that you enter to the database. ... It must not reference anything outside that SQL, such
as database prompts, variables, or native formatting that would normally be supplied by the calling application.
