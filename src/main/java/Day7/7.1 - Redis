Common features for Redis and Memcached :
-	support sub-millisecond response times. By storing data in-memory they can read data more quickly than disk based databases.
-	are syntactically easy to use and require a minimal amount of code to integrate into your application.
-	allow you to distribute your data among multiple nodes. This allows you to scale out to better handle more data when demand grows.
-	have many open-source clients available for developers and support many programming languages
Feature only in Memcached:
-	is multithreaded. It can make use of multiple processing cores. This means that you can handle more
operations by scaling up compute capacity.

Functions only for Redis:
-	In addition to strings, Redis supports lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, bit arrays, and
hyperloglogs. Applications can use these more advanced data structures to support a variety of
use cases. For example, you can use Redis Sorted Sets to easily implement a game leaderboard
that keeps a list of players sorted by their rank.
-	you can keep your data on disk with a point in time snapshot which can be used for archiving or recovery.
-	lets you create multiple replicas of a Redis primary. This allows you to scale database reads
and to have highly available clusters.
-	supports transactions which let you execute a group of commands as an isolated and atomic operation.
-	supports Pub/Sub messaging with pattern matching which you can use for high performance
chat rooms, real-time comment streams, social media feeds, and server intercommunication.
-	allows you to execute transactional Lua scripts. Scripts can help you boost performance
and simplify your application.
-	has purpose-built commands for working with real-time geospatial data at scale. You can
perform operations like finding the distance between two elements (for example people or places)
and finding all elements within a given distance of a point.

Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed, in-memory caching service supporting flexible, real-time
 use cases. Developers can use ElastiCache for caching, which accelerates application and database
 performance, or as a primary data store for use cases that don't require durability like session stores,
 gaming leaderboards, streaming, and analytics. ElastiCache is compatible with Redis and Memcached.
