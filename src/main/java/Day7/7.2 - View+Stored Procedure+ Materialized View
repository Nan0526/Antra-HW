A view represents a virtual table. We can join multiple tables in a view and use the view to present
the data as if the data were coming from a single table. Views are not stored physically on the disk.

A stored procedure uses parameters to do a function when it is updating and inserting data, or
returning single values or data sets.

Materialized View is a physical copy, picture or snapshot of the base table. Materialized View
is updated manually or by applying triggers to it based upon the query definition. Materialized
View responds faster than View as the Materialized View is precomputed.
